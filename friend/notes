with both app running we can see that in the unsolved app, we have many less friends than the solved app

also the removing friends feature does not appear to be working 

first thing to do would be to open app.js to understand the code 

we're importing two components and a json object 

lets start with the Wrapper component 

App.js is importing Wrapper from the Components folder, howerver when we look within the components folder we see that 
Wrapper is a folder not a file. 
When this happens it means that we are importing the index.js from that folder 
but
within index.js we see that it is exporting 
the Wrapper JS file within this directory

why do this? 

This helps with organization 
Because we can keep the css files in the same folder structure as the component file 

When we open the wrapper it looks like the reason we have this is to wrap the inner component within this one 
For styling purposes

the props here would be the friend, cards and header
