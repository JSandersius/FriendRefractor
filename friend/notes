Combine the use of map, state, and props!

with both app running we can see that in the unsolved app, we have many less friends than the solved app

also the removing friends feature does not appear to be working 

first thing to do would be to open app.js to understand the code 

we're importing two components and a json object 

lets start with the Wrapper component 

App.js is importing Wrapper from the Components folder, howerver when we look within the components folder we see that 
Wrapper is a folder not a file. 
When this happens it means that we are importing the index.js from that folder 
but
within index.js we see that it is exporting 
the Wrapper JS file within this directory

why do this? 

This helps with organization 
Because we can keep the css files in the same folder structure as the component file 

When we open the wrapper it looks like the reason we have this is to wrap the inner component within this one 
For styling purposes

the props here would be the friend, cards and header 

when we inspect the wrapper element we an see all of it is CSS

going back to App.js we see that inside the imported json-object 
we see it an array of objects 
it is an array of more than three objects but it is only rendering three 

this is because it is being done manually as we can seen in App.js 

The assignment is to automate this so no matter the length of the array, we can render every single object 

To do this we are going to refactor the code using the JSX funtion MAP 

We're going to make a friend card for each object 
thats going to have the same props that it had before 
however this time we're going to add a KEY and an ID 

we can use the ID property for each object to do this 

--> now all of the friends appear, now we need to fix the delete friend functionality 
to do this we are going to have to maintain something known as React Component State 
The reason to use STATE is, when we remove a friend, we want the component to automatically re-render itself and keep track of 
	which friends to render and which to not
		we are NOT going to modify the json object every time a friend is removed

in order to maintain state, we're going to have to refactor the component into a class
	by extending --> component which is imported from the react package
		we're creating a brand new class with all the features provided by the component class 

we need to start by importing component from react--> then we will change const to class and instead of a parenthesis
	we will have a bracket
		we also have to remember to render our component when we use classes 

--> what is a class yuo wonder? go to this url

  //setting states is easy, we just assign properties to state sepereated my commas 
  // in this case we're going to take advantage of ES6 and only type friends because the friends property is going to be equal to the friends array 
  //which is imported from friends.json 

  //  Setting this.state.friends to the friends json array 

  we're now going to have to create the remove friend function 
  it is pretty simple, when the user clicks the X, the remove_friend_function will be triggered, we will then remove the friend from list.state.friends 
  	in order to identify which friend, we're going to pass the id prop from the component in which the X was selected 
  		lets make that on-click function now 
  			we first have to pass the remove card function down to the friend card component


Ok we learned about state and classes as well as map
